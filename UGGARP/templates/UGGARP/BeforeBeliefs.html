In the next section you will be shown the parts of the tables of potential Proposal Rules.
You will be asked what do you think is the percent chance that each of the displayed Proposal Rule would be <i>Rejected</i> by the <b>Responder</b>. Please provide the number between 0 and 100, which would specify the percent chance.
<br>
<br>

You will be able to earn <b>up to $10</b> in addition to your earnings in the decision stage.
You will receive the additional payment if you would be able to outperform the random machine in predicting the behavior of others.
The earnings will be according to the following procedure, after you submit all <i> predictions </i>:
<br>
<br>

<ol>
	<li> One of the proposal rules is chosen at random</li>

	<li> One participant from the people participated in the session (excluding You) is picked at random and her <i>decision</i> is retrieved</li>

	<li> Your <i> error</i> is computed as <i>(prediction/100)<sup>2</sup></i> if the decision picked is <i>Accept</i> or <i>(1-prediction/100)<sup>2</sup></i> if the decision picked is <i>Reject</i></li>

	<li> The uniform <i>random number</i> is drawn form the interval from <i>0</i> to <i>1</i></li>

	<li> You receive additional $10 if your <i> error</i> is below <i>random number</i> and do not receive any additional payment otherwise.
</ol>
