	<h4>Procedure</h4><br>

In the next section you will be asked what do you think is the percent chance that each of the displayed Proposal Rules is <i>Rejected</i> by the <i>Responder</i>. 
Please provide a number between 0 and 100 - the percentage chance with which you think the <b>Responder</b> will <i>Reject</i> the Proposal Rule.

<br><br>

You will make 12 predictions for different proposal rules in total. 
One of them will be chosen to determine your payment.
Your payment in this round will depend on your decisions and a chance. 

<br>
<br>

<h4>Payment</h4><br>

You will be able to earn <b>up to $10</b> in addition to your earnings in the decision stage.
You will receive the additional payment if you would be able to outperform the random machine in predicting the behavior other participants in the room.
The earnings will be according to the following procedure, after you submit all <i> predictions </i>:
<br>
<br>

<ol>
	<li> One of the proposal rules is chosen at random</li>

	<li> One participant from the session (excluding You) is picked at random and her <i>decision</i> is retrieved </li>

	<li> Your <i> error</i> is computed as <i>(prediction/100)<sup>2</sup></i> if the decision picked is <i>Accept</i> or <i>(1-prediction/100)<sup>2</sup></i> if the decision picked is <i>Reject</i></li>

	<li> A uniform <i>random number</i> is drawn form the interval from <i>0</i> to <i>1</i></li>

	<li> You receive $10 (in addition to money you already earned) if your <i> error</i> is below <i>random number</i> and do not receive any additional payment otherwise.
</ol> 
<br><br>

<h4>Examples</h4><br>

Assume you think that 50% of <b>Responders</b> rejected the proposal rule under consideration.
We will consider three cases.

<br><br>

Assume you predict that there is a 50% chance a <b> Responder</b> will <i>Reject</i> the offer. <br>
If the randomly retrieved decision was <i>Reject</i>, 
your error is (1-50/100)<sup>2</sup>=.3<sup>2</sup>=.25.
Since the probability a random number is drawn between 0.25 and 1 is 75%, you will get $10 with 75% probability and $0 with 25% probability.
If the randomly retrieved decision was <i>Accept</i>,
your error is (50/100)<sup>2</sup>=.5<sup>2</sup>=.25.
Since the probability a random number is drawn between 0.25 and 1 is 75%, you will get $10 with 75% probability and $0 with 25% probability.
Assuming that with probability .5 the randomly retrieved decision is <b>Reject</b> and with probability .5 is <b>Accept</b>.
Hence, your probability of winning the additional prize is .5 &#xD7;  .75 + .5 &#xD7;  .75 = .75.
That is <b>you will earn extra $10 with probability 75%</b>.

<br><br>

Assume instead that you report that with 0% probability a <b>Responder</b> will <i>Reject</i> the offer. 
<br>
If the randomly retrieved decision was <i>Reject</i>.
Hence, your error is (1-0/100)<sup>2</sup>=1<sup>2</sup>=1.
Since the probability a random number is drawn between 1 and 1 is 0%, you will get $10 with 0% probability and $0 with 100% probability.
If the randomly retrieved decision was <i>Accept</i>.
Hence, your error is (0/100)<sup>2</sup>=.0<sup>2</sup>=.0.
Since the probability a random number is drawn between 0 and 1 is 100%, you will get $10 with 100% probability and $0 with 0% probability.
Assuming that with probability .5 the randomly retrieved decision is <b>Reject</b> and with probability .5 is  <b>Accept</b>.
Hence, your probability of winning the additional prize is .0 &#xD7;  .5 + 1 &#xD7;  .5 = .5.
That is  <b>you will earn extra $10 with probability 50%</b>.
Which is lower than probability of winning if you would report your real expectation (75%).


<br><br>

Assume instead that you report that with 100% probability a <b>Responder</b> will <i>Reject</i> the offer.
<br>
If the randomly retrieved decision was <i>Reject</i>.
Hence, your error is (1-100/100)<sup>2</sup>=0.
Since the probability a random number is drawn between 0.0 and 1 is 100%, you will <i>always</i> get paid is the retrieved decision if <i>Reject</i>.
If the randomly retrieved decision was <i>Accept</i>.
Hence, your error is (100/100)<sup>2</sup>=1<sup>2</sup>=1.
In this case you will <i>never</i> get paid is the retrieved decision if <i>Accept</i>.
Assuming that with probability .5 the randomly retrieved decision is <b>Reject</b> and with probability .5 is <b>Accept</b>.
Hence, your probability of winning the additional prize is .5 &#xD7;  1 + .5 &#xD7;  0 = .5.
That is <b>you will earn extra $10 with probability 50%</b>.
Which is lower than probability of winning if you would report your real expectation (75%).

<br><br>

As we illustrated above in order to maximize your probability of winning please honestly report the probability of winning which would be as close as possible to the real frequency of rejecting the offer.
Since any deviation from honest report will only decrease your probability of winning.
